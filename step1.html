<h2>Hello world</h2>

<h3>A basic client as a first step</h3>
<p>
Usually, first step when creating a GUI app is to draw some mockups. It can be
done with any tool (including good old paper + pencil), but you'll have to
consider the ncurses interface, so maybe using libyui itself to write the mockup
is not a bad idea.
</p>
<p>
As explained in "YaST architecture" at http://yast.github.io/documentation.html,
executing YaST means actually calling a YaST client. So let's write a client
that will draw our mockup.
</p>
<h3>Checkout the initial mockup</h3>
First, checkout the initial commit of the repo.
{% highlight bash %}
git checkout hello_world
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Browsing the code</h3>
<p>
The repo now contains just a 'src' directory to mimic the structure described in "YaST code
organization description" at http://yast.github.io/documentation.html
</p>
<p>
Let's take a look to /clients/mockup.rb and
lib/systemd_journal/mockup_dialog.rb.
Brief explanation of the code.
</p>

<h3>Running the code</h3>
<p>
You could be tempted to use rake run, but it will not work because there is no
Rakefile. Don't worry. Let's forget about the magic for now. And let's run the
mockup client manually.
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
Y2DIR=src/ /usr/sbin/yast2 mockup
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The only possible interaction is closing. Let's also take a look to ~/.y2log.
Now. Let's take a look to how it looks in ncurses (press 'esc' to exit)
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
Y2DIR=src/ /usr/sbin/yast2 --ncurses mockup
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
You can see the debugging output again in  ~/.y2log
</p>

<h3>Rejoice!</h3>
<p>
Celebrate your first YaST module. Once you are done with celebration, proceed to <a
  href="step2.html">the second step</a>.
